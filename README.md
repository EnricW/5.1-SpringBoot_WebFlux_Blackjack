# Reactive Blackjack API with Spring WebFlux üÉè

## Description

This project implements a reactive Blackjack game API using Spring WebFlux. The application connects to and manages information in two different databases: MongoDB and MySQL. The Blackjack game includes all necessary functionalities like player management, card hands, and game rules.

## Technical Requirements

- Java JDK 17 or higher
- Maven
- Spring Boot (latest stable version)
- MongoDB
- MySQL
- IDE (IntelliJ IDEA, Eclipse, VS Code, etc.)
- Postman or similar for API testing
- Docker

## Configuration

### Dependencies

- Spring WebFlux
- Spring Data Reactive MongoDB
- Spring Data JPA
- MySQL Connector
- Reactor Test
- JUnit
- Mockito
- Swagger/OpenAPI for documentation

## Project Structure

The project is structured following a reactive architecture with the following packages:

```
cat.itacademy.blackjack.controller    ‚Üí Contains reactive REST controllers
cat.itacademy.blackjack.model         ‚Üí Contains entity classes
cat.itacademy.blackjack.service       ‚Üí Contains reactive business logic
cat.itacademy.blackjack.repository    ‚Üí Contains reactive repositories
cat.itacademy.blackjack.exception     ‚Üí Contains global exception handling
cat.itacademy.blackjack.config        ‚Üí Configuration classes
cat.itacademy.blackjack.dto           ‚Üí Data Transfer Objects
```

## Database Configuration

The application is configured to use two different database schemas:

- **MongoDB**: For storing game states and real-time game data
- **MySQL**: For storing player information and game statistics

## API Endpoints

### 1. Create New Game

```http
POST /games
```

**Body (JSON):**

```json
{
  "playerName": "PlayerName"
}
```

**Returns:** Details of the created game with status code **201 Created**.

---

### 2. Get Game Details

```http
GET /games/{id}
```

**Parameter:** `id` of the game**Returns:** Detailed information about the game.

---

### 3. Get all Games

```http
GET /games
```

**Returns:** Detailed information about the games.

---

### 4. Make a Move

```http
POST /games/{id}/moves
```

**Parameter:** `id` of the game**Body (JSON):**

```json
{
  "moveType": "HIT"
}
```

**Returns:** Result of the move and current state of the game.

---

### 5. Delete Game

```http
DELETE /games/{id}
```

**Parameter:** `id` of the game**Returns:** Status code **204 No Content** if the game is successfully deleted.

---

### 6. Get Player Rankings

```http
GET /ranking
```

**Returns:** List of players ordered by their ranking position and score.

---

### 7. Change Player Name

```http
PUT /player/{playerId}
```

**Parameter:** `playerId` of the player**Body (JSON):**

```json
{
  "name": "NewPlayerName"
}
```

---

## Error Handling

The application implements a `GlobalExceptionHandler` to handle exceptions across the entire application:

- If a **game or player ID** does not exist, it returns **404 Not Found**.
- If the request is incorrect, it returns **400 Bad Request**.
- If an **invalid move** is attempted, it returns a specific error message.
- Internal server errors are handled with **500 Internal Server Error**.

---

## Testing

The application includes unit tests for controllers and services using **JUnit and Mockito**:

- **Controller tests** to verify API endpoints work correctly.
- **Service tests** to ensure business logic functions as expected.

---

## API Documentation

The API is documented using **Swagger**. Once the application is running, you can access the Swagger UI at:

[http://localhost:8080/swagger-ui.html](http://localhost:8080/swagger-ui.html)

---

## Docker Setup

### Step 1: Create `Dockerfile`

Create a `Dockerfile` in the root directory:

```dockerfile
FROM openjdk:17-jdk-slim

WORKDIR /app

COPY target/*.jar app.jar

EXPOSE 8080

ENTRYPOINT ["java", "-jar", "app.jar"]
```

---

### Step 2: Create `.dockerignore`

Create a `.dockerignore` file:

```
target/*
!target/*.jar
.git
.gitignore
.idea
*.iml
```

---

### Step 3: Build the Docker Image

```bash
docker build -t blackjack-api .
```

---

### Step 4: Run the Docker Image

```bash
docker run -p 8080:8080 blackjack-api
```

---

### Step 5: Tag the Docker Image

```bash
docker tag blackjack-api username/blackjack-api:latest
```

---

### Step 6: Login to Docker Hub

```bash
docker login
```

---

### Step 7: Push the Image to Docker Hub

```bash
docker push username/blackjack-api:latest
```

---

### Step 8: Test the Docker Image

Pull and run the image to verify it works correctly:

```bash
docker pull username/blackjack-api:latest
docker run -p 8080:8080 username/blackjack-api:latest
```

---

## Running the Application

1. **Clone the repository**
2. **Configure the MongoDB and MySQL connection details** in `application.properties`
3. **Build the project**
   ```bash
   mvn clean install
   ```
4. **Run the application**
   ```bash
   mvn spring-boot:run
   ```
5. **The API will be available at:**   [http://localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080)
